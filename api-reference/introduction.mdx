<Info>
  AiFlow's API is currently in beta. If you have any questions or feedback,
  please reach out to us at
  [support@aiflow.solutions](mailto:support@aiflow.solutions?subject=AiFlow%20API%20Feedback).
</Info>

## Base URL

AiFlow's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```bash Terminal
https://www.app.aiflow.solutions
```

## Authentication

Authentication to AiFlow's API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word `Bearer` followed by your API key in your requests like so:

```bash Terminal
Authorization: Bearer <Your-Token>
```

Learn more about [how to get your API key](/api-reference/tokens).

## Response Codes

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are a few examples:

| Code  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | The request was successful.                                                                    |
| `400` | The request was invalid or cannot be served.                                                   |
| `401` | The request requires user authentication.                                                      |
| `403` | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                |
| `404` | The requested resource could not be found.                                                     |
| `429` | Too many requests.                                                                             |
| `500` | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

## Caveats

- AiFlow's API is currently in public beta and is subject to change. However, we will do our best to keep breaking changes to a minimum.
